# File for adjoint sources.
# PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE FORMATTING OF THE FILE, including these comments (changing tabs and spaces inside a station/measurement line is fine) 
# FORMAT FOR EACH STATION :
# Name, network, latitude, longitude, depth, number of measurements
# FORMAT FOR EACH MEASUREMENT :
# time window start, time window end, filter type, filter params, measurement value 
# One skipped line between station and measurements, two between different stations
# MEASUREMENT_TYPE can be traveltime / amplitude / waveform 
# If measurement type is waveform, include DATA_PATH, and measurement value column for each measurement will be name of seismogram
